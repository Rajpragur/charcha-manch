## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Firebase project with Firestore enabled
- Firebase Storage enabled (for media uploads)

### 2. Firebase Configuration
Update your Firebase configuration in `src/configs/firebase.ts`:

```typescript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "your-api-key",
  authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "your-project-id",
  storageBucket: "your-project.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "your-sender-id",
  appId: "your-app-id"
};
```

### 3. Firestore Security Rules
Update your Firestore rules to allow discussion forum access:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Discussion posts - public read, authenticated write
    match /discussion_posts/{postId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Constituencies - public read
    match /constituencies/{constituencyId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if false; // Admin only
    }
    
    // User profiles - user can read/write own profile
    match /user_profiles/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 5. Load Sample Data
Run the setup script to populate your database with sample constituencies and discussion posts:

```bash
# Update the Firebase config in the script first
node scripts/setup-discussion-forum.js
```

This will create:

- 8 sample discussion posts
- Constituency scores and statistics

  { id: 11, name: 'New Constituency', area_name: 'New Area', district: 'New District', state: 'Bihar' },
  // ... more constituencies
];
```

### Modifying Post Layout

- Action buttons
- Media display

### Adding New Features
The forum is built with a modular architecture. You can easily add:

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Posts not loading**
   - Check Firebase configuration
   - Verify Firestore rules
   - Check browser console for errors

2. **Media uploads failing**
   - Ensure Firebase Storage is enabled
   - Check storage rules
   - Verify file size limits (10MB max)

3. **Constituency filter not working**
   - Run the setup script to create constituencies
   - Check if constituencies collection exists in Firestore

4. **Search not working**
   - Ensure Fuse.js is properly installed
   - Check if posts have proper content structure

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by adding this to your browser console:
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('debug', 'true');
```

## üìä Performance Optimization

### Database Queries
- Posts are fetched with pagination
- Constituency filtering uses indexed queries
- Search uses client-side fuzzy matching for better performance

### Caching
- Constituency data is cached locally
- Post data is refreshed on demand
- Media files are cached by the browser

## üîí Security Considerations

### Content Moderation
- Posts are automatically checked for inappropriate content
- Admin approval system for new posts
- User reporting system (can be implemented)

### Data Privacy
- User IDs are not exposed in public posts
- Personal information is protected
- Anonymous posting option available
